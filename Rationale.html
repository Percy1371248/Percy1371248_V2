            This is project Chrxxmas, a portfolio website based on my alter ego named Chrxxmas,pronounced like
            Christmas.

         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            What is Christmas? Is it a holiday? Jesus’s Birthday? Time for family? Yes, that is all true but not in
            this case. Chrxxmas is an Alter Ego, a colourful being filled with joy and wonder. He wants to create work
            that excites not only him but those around him as well. He is boundless and seeks to learn more with what
            interests him.He is not perfect and he has his fair share of struggles that even extent to areas he has
            interests. However,it’s that interest that keeps him going and that will hopefully make himbetter than what
            he was yesterday. Oh, and Chrxxmas has a pet Octopus, his spirit animal. It is one of the oddest creatures
            in the world,sometimes considered to be out of this world, and it adapts well to different situations.
         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            The reason Chrxxmas is spelt with two XX’s is to set me apart from the Holiday, but believe me when I say
            that in the future, you will not be able to hear the word Christmas without actually thinking about me… the
            same way you think about the pop artist Mr World Wide when you hear Pitbull. His slogan “Seems like the
            perfect time for my nonsense” means that in anytime or moment there is always time for his work to be
            prominent.
         </p>

         <p class="blogPa">
            The purpose of the website is to display my portfolio in 3 fields that I enjoy, 2D & 3D Animation and
            illustrations. I have made small scale projects that I have displayed on my site. The main feel I wanted to
            give my artworks as well as the website was a mystical/surrealist feel. All the artists I look up to have
            achieved this from traditional artists like Salvador Dali and Frida Khalo to modern 3D artists like Antonio
            Tudisco and local artist African Ginger.


         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            For the website itself, I wanted to implement the technique of long scrolling. All the websites I looked at
            for reference, used this technique. It easy scrolling through their work and I barely had to use the
            navigation bar. Nick Babich ,a developer and UX lover, defines long scrolling as “a variety of long
            scrolling that allows users to scroll through a massive chunk of content with no finish line in sight (it’s
            the endless scrolling you see on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr feeds) (Babich 2017).” It has the ability to
            get users interested. Scrolling minimizes the cost of engagement needed to accomplish a set of user
            objectives. The benefit of not having to select next keeps users active with the content and less focused on
            navigating to the next page mechanics. (Babich 2017)For mobile devices, it translates well. In the
            widespread adoption of this technique, the increased use of handheld screens played a key role: the smaller
            the monitor, the longer the scroll. Mobile devices' gesture controls make scrolling intuitive and
            enjoyable(Babich 2017).The current layout of my desktop version does not rely on scrolling like the mobile
            does. I needed more content for it be functional in the desktop version. Hopefully, I will achieve this
            scrolling effect in the future as I grow as an artist and produce more content.

         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            To help me achieve my surrealistic effect I needed to consider the colours I would use. The main colour for
            my theme is purple and various shades of purple. I chose this colour because it represents my aura and has a
            mystical/magical like feel to it. It calms and soothes those who look at it(Lubos 2008:99). The colour of my
            text is mostly white as it easily stands out for the user. I placed my blogs on top of a dark background to
            help make the text easily readable without strain coming from light or bright colours. I chose the
            Montserrat font for the blogs and the Ubuntu font for the overall text of the site as I found them soft on
            the eyes. The fonts for the header pages will be the Anton font as it has a strong bold presence.

         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            There is still room for improvement in both the website and the content I set out to create but I do believe
            that the website is industry ready, meaning that when people look at it they going to see my potential and
            be promoted to say “ I want to work with you”.
