            This is project Chrxxmas, portfolio website based on my alter ego named Chrxxmas,pronounced like
            Christmas.

         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            “What is Christmas?Is it a holiday?Jesus’s Birthday?Time for family?Yes,that is all true but not in
            this case.Chrxxmas is an Alter Ego,a colourful being filled with Joy and wonder.He wants to create work
            that excites him and those around him.He is boundless and seeks to learn more with what interests him.He
            is not perfect and struggles a lot even in areas he has interests in but it’s that interest that keeps him
            going to hopefully be better than what he was yesterday oh and he has a pet Octopus,his spirit animal”
         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            The reason Chrxxmas is spelt with 2 XX is to set me apart from the Holiday but believe me that in the future
            you will not be able to hear the word Christmas without actually thinking about me,just like how when you
            hear
            Pit Bull you can’t help but to think of the pop artist Mr World Wide.
         </p>

         <p class="blogPa">
            The purpose of the website is to display my portfolio in 3 fields that I enjoy, 2D & 3D Animation and
            illustrations.I am currently working on small scale projects within these fields so I may display them on
            the site.The main feel I want to give my artworks as well as the website is a mystical/surrealist feel All
            the artists I look up to have achieved this from traditional artists like Salvador Dali and Frida Khalo to
            modern 3D artists like Antonio Tudisco and local artist African Ginger.


         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            I also wanted to implement the technique of long scrolling.
            All the website I looked at for references used this technique. It felt easy scrolling through their work
            and I barely had to use the navigation bar.
            Nick Babich ,a developer and UX lover, defines long scrolling as “variety of long scrolling that allows
            users to scroll through a massive chunk of content with no finish line in sight (it’s the endless scrolling
            you see on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr feeds) (Babich 2017).”
            It has the ability to get users interested.(Scrolling minimizes the cost of engagement needed to accomplish
            a set of user objectives. The benefit of not having to select "next" keeps users active with the content and
            less focused on navigating to the next page mechanics.)(Babich 2017)
            For mobile devices, it translates well. In the widespread adoption of this technique,the increased use of
            handheld screens played a key role: the smaller the monitor, the longer the scroll.
            Mobile devices' gesture controls make scrolling intuitive and enjoyable(Babich 2017).The current layout of
            my desktop version does not rely on scrolling like the mobile does.I needed more content for it be
            functional in the desktop version. Hopefully,I will achieve this scrolling effect in the future as I grow
            as an artist and produce more content.

         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            To help me achieve my surrealistic effect I need to consider the colours I use and how. The main colour for
            my theme is purple and various shades of purple.
            I chose this colour because it represents my aura, has a mystical/magic like feel to it and it calms and
            soothes those who look at it(Lubos 2008:99).The colour of my text is mostly white as it easily stands out
            for the user.
            I placed my blogs on top of a black background to help make the text easily readable without strain coming
            from light or bright colours.I chose the Montserrat font for the blogs and the Ubuntu font for the overall
            text of the site as I found them soft on the eyes.
            The fonts for the header pages will be the Anton font as it has a strong bold presence.

         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            I am confident that at the end, the website will be industry ready,meaning that when people look at it I
            want them to see my potential and promote someone to say “I want to work with you”.
