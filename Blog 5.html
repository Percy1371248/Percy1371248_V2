         <h1 class="blogHeader">Digital Inequalities</h1>

         <p class="blogPa">
            Digital divide is a term that refers to the difference between populations and areas that have access to
            advanced information and communications technology and those that have limited access to it.The telephone,
            TV,personal computers,and the internet can be part of this technology(Rouse 2014).In terms of
            socio-economic status,education,gender,age,geographic location,job status and race,digital
            inequalities tend to mirror current social inequalities.Similarly, historically disadvantaged citizens are
            poor on the Internet,for instance,having restricted access to technology,limited opportunities for use,
            and lack of significant digital skills.(Lutz 2019:141)

         </p>

         <p class="blogPa">
            In the paper “Digital inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence and big data” -Christopher Lutz
            describes 3 levels of the digital divide.

         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            Unequal internet access is represented in the first-level digital divide.The digital divide was alluded to
            in this early use of the word as the difference between those who do and those who do not have access to
            modern types of information technology(Lutz 2019:141).Napoli and Obar(2014)created the notion of the
            mobile internet underclass to problematize mobile internet access,a good example of a theory-based
            first-level digital divide approach.According to this theory,as opposed to traditional/nonmobile
            internet access,mobile internet access is second-class internet access(Lutz 2019:142).In terms of speed,
            memory and storage capacity,mobile internet access provides lower functionality.It also has physical
            limitations,such as screen size and keyboard usability,for instance.Therefore,on a mobile phone,complex
            yet useful activities such as editing text documents and tables(e.g. Microsoft Word or Excel ) are much
            more difficult to do.Mobile access to the internet is therefore defined as extractive rather than
            immersive.(Lutz 2019:142)


         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            Hargittai(2002) coined the term second-level digital divide to distinguish binary inequalities in internet
            access(first-level) from inequalities in qualifications and uses(second-level)(Lutz 2019:142).The digital
            divide at the second level, also referred to as the output gap,defines the gap that divides content users
            from content producers on the internet.(PennState)
         </p>

         <p class="blogPa">
            Web 2.0 technologies such as Facebook,YouTube, Twitter,and Blogs allow users to connect and build content
            online without having to understand how the technology actually functions,leading to an increasing digital
            divide between those with the expertise and experience to communicate more completely with the technology
            and those who are passive users of it.(PennState)
         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            Material factors such as the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet
            are some of the reasons for this production gap.The more often an individual has access to the Internet and
            the easier the connection,the more opportunities they have to learn the skills of technology and the more
            opportunity they have to be innovative.Cultural factors frequently associated with class and social status
            are other causes.(PennState)
         </p>

         <p class="blogPa">
            The digital divisions of the third level refer to differences in the gains from Internet usage,
            particularly where patterns of access and use are roughly comparable.Therefore,third-level divisions refer
            to differences in the ability of individuals to convert their internet access and usage into desirable
            offline outcomes,but the true definition of a digital third-level divide as an extension of first-and
            second-level divisions.(Lutz 2019: 144)
         </p>
         <p class="blogPa">
            The dynamic is defined by a Matthew Effect,where the wealthy get wealthier and use technology to improve
            their place in society,as some people benefit disproportionately from Internet use and can exploit these
            advantages to enhance their social status,thereby exacerbating established social inequality.As an
            example,the Winkelvoss brothers have invested heavily in cryptocurrencies,already from privileged
            backgrounds,becoming the first crypto billionaires as of 2018 (Kauflin, 2018).On the other hand, although
            bitcoin is often touted as a poverty-fighting solution(Forbes, 2015),it faces many systemic barriers and
            is not a viable solution for underprivileged people at this point.(Lutz 2019:144)
         </p>

         <p class="blogPa">
            I personally have not experienced an extreme level of the digital divide but that does not mean the rest of
            the country has not.An imbalance on the distribution and access of resources in South Africa has always
            been evident due to our strides to being a first world country.Currently we experience the first two levels
            of the digital divide,where one child’s problem is actually accessing the internet while the other is
            figuring out how to use and maximise web 2.0 technologies,I am the second child.
